  content: Thanks! I was just thinking to myself how great it would be if there were
    some really clear Wade instructions like the PRUSA set .. and poof! here it is!!
    Thanks for your service to the community.

  content: Yes, thank you. These super clear instructions really helped me build.
    It saves people time instead of having to keep using google images for different
    angles of other user's semi-built extruder parts.

  content: "Great document for wades.  You don't know how much time it has saved me.
    Keep it up!!!\r\n\r\nOne comment.  There are two ways to mount the wades to the
    Prusa carriage.  You show the Parallel method.  I think the perpendicular wades
    method allows more build area.  Can you describe the two methods when you update
    the document?  Perhaps telling the builder his options? Pros and cons?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDave"

  content: Great job on the instructions, reminds me of Lego Technique or K'Nex instructions.
    I think I found one minor error though, in the parts list I didn't find the set/grub
    screw used in step 14.

  content: Thanks for all of your work on this! A review of the Prusa visual instructions
    leaves me impressed, but I am unable to view the instructions for the extruder
    as I receive a "file not found" error. When you have an opportunity, would you
    please kindly check the link? Much appreciated.

  content: Hi there, I just checked the links and they all seem to work for me.  If
    you could let me know exactly which one I will investigate further.  In the mean
    time the PDF files are directly available in the github project (<a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/wades_geared_extruder_visual_instructions/tree/master/dist"

    it helps me finish my prusa mendel easily and understand quitly well the working
    of a prusa.\r\nI'm actually studying the oportunity to sell prusa mendel kitted
    and mounted and would like to know if the use of your manual is allowed.\r\nAlso
    what should be respected to show all the respesct due to your work?\r\n\r\nI can't
    find your e-mail so i hope we'll be able to get in touch through this message!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your help,\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nFranck"

  content: Outstanding work!  It is my intent to create an extruder to mount on my
    CNC milling table.  With these instructions, I should be able to create that portion,
    but I still have man y questions on the hot portion for the project.  Where can
    information be obtained for these details, e.g. temperature, hole size, etc.  Thanks.

    Hi,

    The wiki has a section listing some hot end techniques: http://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Hot_End

    You may also want to browse the list of hot end developments here too: http://reprap.development-tracker.info/developments/categories/HotEnd

    Adrian's extruder design is pretty thorough in explaining how to build one: http://reprap.org/wiki/Geared_extruder_nozzle

    Best of luck!

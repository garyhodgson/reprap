  content: Nice, though I think I'd rather have most of that type of information in
    comments at the beginning of the file, rather than in the file name.

  content: Good point, I had forgotten that gcode files can have comments in - would
    be much neater.  The one benefit of having it in the filename is one doesn't have
    to open the file to see them.

  content: "Hi,  very nice enhancement.  I love it (though it is cluttering my Folders
    ATM..\r\nmaybe an option to put them into a seperate folder?.  \r\nIf you are
    so good with python maybe you can help me to include some automation for the settings?
    \  As I am no programmer, I can read the python code but I am unable to write
    someting new... or make slight changes...\r\n\r\nCan you help?   My version of
    SF:  https://github.com/ahmetcemturan/skeinforge\r\nYour export mdule is also
    included there.\r\n\r\nThx.   You can email me for further discussion."

  content: That's great Ahmet - sounds like you got to grips with python then.  Simplifying
    SF is certainly a good idea.

<p>I decided to add a few features to the export module of Skeinforge which may also be useful to others. &nbsp;I've committed these changes to <a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/skeinforge">my fork of the (unofficial) git repo</a>. &nbsp;If they seem popular then i'll fire an email to Enrique with a patch.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-617" title="export_options" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/export_options.png" alt="" width="547" height="606" /></p>

<h2>Add Profile To File Extension</h2>

<p>Simply adds the current profile to the file extension, &nbsp;e.g. <em>test.my_profile_name.gcode.</em></p>

<h2>Archive Used Profile As Zip</h2>

<p>Creates a Zip file archive of the current profile, e.g. <em>test.my_profile_name.zip</em></p>

<h2>Export Profile Values As CSV File</h2>

<p>Creates a Comma Separated Value file containing all profile values, e.g. <em>test.my_profile_name.csv. </em></p>

<p>The format is: plugin,name,value, e.g.&nbsp;<em>carve,Layer Thickness (mm):,0.4</em></p>

<p><em><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-641" title="example_csv" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/example_csv.png" alt="" width="640" height="466" /><br />
</em></p>

<h2>Add Descriptive Extension</h2>

<p>Because I am inconsistent in my profile management I often tweak a setting of a profile before printing. &nbsp;This means the profile name usually does not reflect the actual profile values. &nbsp;This option adds key profile values as&nbsp;an extension to the gcode file. If a module is turned off then the value is not added to the extension.</p>

<p>E.g. <em><filename>.04hx06w_33Ff_03fill.4off.gcode </em>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>04h </strong>= "Layer Thickness (mm):" 0.4</li>
<li>x</li>
<li><strong>06w </strong>= 0.6 width i.e. 0.4 times "Perimeter Width over Thickness (ratio):" 1.5</li>
<li>_</li>
<li><strong>33Ff </strong>= "Flow Rate Setting (float):" 33.0 and "Feed Rate (mm/s):" 33.0. &nbsp;If either value has a positive value after the decimal place then this is also shown, but if it is zero it is hidden. &nbsp;Also, if the values differ (which they shouldn't with 5D volumetrics) then each is displayed seperately, i.e. 30F35.2f = "Flow Rate Setting (float):" 30.0 and "Feed Rate (mm/s):" 35.2</li>
<li>_</li>
<li><strong>03fill </strong>= "Infill Solidity (ratio):" 0.3</li>
<li><strong>4off </strong>= "Number of Columns (integer):" x "Number of Rows (integer):" from the Multiply Tab, e.g. 2x2. &nbsp;If these values are both 1 then this part is not shown.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Add Timestamp Extension</h2>
<p>Adds the current date and time as an extension in format YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS (so it is sortable if one has many files), e.g. <em>test.my_profile_name.20110613_220113.gcode</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-618" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="example_files" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/example_files.png" alt="" width="600" height="67" /></p>
<p>Using all the options together yields a few files with long names but it means that each time a STL is processed one can:</p>
<ul>
<li>see which profile was used (from the filename),</li>
<li>see which key values were used &nbsp;(from the filename),</li>
<li>see all the profile values (from the csv),</li>
<li>recreate the profile (from the zip),</li>
<li>and ensure sure that all gcode files are unique and not overwritten each time&nbsp;(with timestamp).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

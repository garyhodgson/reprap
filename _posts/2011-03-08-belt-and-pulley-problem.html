<p>It seems that there is a problem with the teeth of the belt not meshing well with the pulley. Every few rotations the belt rides up on a tooth and causes the movement to stutter. &nbsp;Hmm, to the forums I think.</p>

<p>[ Edit @ 21.03.11: After hooking up the motors and doing some testing it <em>seems</em> that this meshing problem doesn't cause the plate or head to jump. &nbsp;Perhaps the tension from the motor doesn't cause the problem whereas it does when moving by hand? &nbsp;Further tests to be done! ]</p>

  content: "You are right, that hot end won't last long.\r\nThe bronze piece will
    be pushed out of the PFTE after 10 to 20 hours of operation.\r\nTake a look at
    Wolfgang's design (Stoffel15) at his <a href=\"http://reprap-fab.org/index.php?cPath=22&amp;osCsid=2eb32g5dp4t57397at8ed5djk7\"
    title=\"website\" rel=\"nofollow\">.\r\nAlso the PFTE expands when warm changing
    your z-axis 0 point!\r\nPeek with a teflon inner tube works well.\r\nUsing a resistor
    block as a heater provides thermal mass and is easier than winding the nichrome
    wire.\r\nBTW I work in Karlsruhe, live in W&ouml;rth am Rhein."

  content: "Thanks for the advice Robert!  Once I make my first successful print I
    already plan on \"upgrading\" several parts - and I think the hot end will be
    first, so all pointers are welcome.\r\n\r\nNice to meet someone else from the
    area! Perhaps we should start a Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg RUG :)\r\n\r\nAnd thanks
    for letting me know about the lack of comment-editing!  I'll install a plugin
    to correct that tonight.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

<p>This Hot End looks too neat and pretty, so I guess it won't last long. I suspect the red front wire connection will melt once it gets too full temperature, but i'll give it a go tomorrow.</p>

<p>I also successfully got the <a title="Testing the Heating Element" href="http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2011/03/testing-the-heating-element/">test setup</a> to heat up to 200&deg;C and manually fed some PLA through.</p>

  content: "Your visual instruction manual is GREAT.\r\n\r\nI've ordered a Prusa Mendel
    kit from MakerGear which I expect to receive about the middle of April (2011),
    so your instruction manual comes at just the right time for me.\r\n\r\nOne comment:
    \ The bottom corner printed connections don' have feet in the illustrations.\r\n\r\nOne
    question:  What rods or other parts, if any, need to be oiled or greased?\r\n\r\n--

  content: "Hi Donald, glad you like the guide, I hope it's useful when your kit arrives.
    \ It's a lot of fun putting it together!\r\n\r\nThe earlier Mendel design had
    bottom vertices without feet, and when I started building the SketchUp model I
    used vertices from an older version - hence the lack of feet in the guide.  If
    I get a chance to update the pictures with footed vertices I will do, just to
    avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nAnd re: greased rods - the smooth rods I received were
    \"pre-greased\" a little, and so far they seem to be running for me ok - but it's
    still early days with my Mendel.  And just tonight I had to drop some lubricant
    on the Z threaded rods because they had started to creak and squeak!  The real
    problem is that one of them is slightly wobbly, so I have to do some work on it
    - but the lube got rid of the annoying noise :)  For info, I used a very low viscous
    lubricant that's usually used on skateboards and such (thanks to my skateboarder
    wife, it was lying around!) and this seemed to work well.\r\n\r\nHope it helps,.
    \  Good luck on the build!"

  content: "Hey Gary,\r\nThanks for the amazing guide. It helps a lot to have all
    the visuals to go with the text. I'm on \"Part 2\", trying to do one part every
    night. I'll take notes as I go through the build if there are any improvements
    to be made. Is there any chance you could convert the .pub to an open format?
    I forked your git repo so I could just make changes and send pull requests, but
    I don't have any way to edit the .pub. I guess I'll just create issues on github.\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nBrad"

  content: "Thanks Brad - I'm glad it helps.  \n\nI agree that the Publisher format
    isn't very useful in an \"open\" project, it was, however, something I could use
    quickly.  I will see if it can convert to something a bit more open-friendly when
    I next get a chance. And there are also plans to put the whole thing into the
    wiki - I just have to work out how not to overload the instructions page <i>and</i>
    keep the layout looking good :)\n\nI recommend looking through the existing issues
    that people have raised - as some of these should be worked back into the Prusa
    instructions and could save you a couple of (minor) headaches.  And of course
    feel free to raise whatever ideas and issues on github yourself!"

<p>Whilst building my Prusa Mendel I started playing with <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/" target="_blank">Google SketchUp</a>, and&nbsp;when I came across a <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=86dc5e3cc80958355ad914839c51e370&amp;ct=mdsa" target="_blank">model of the Mendel</a> it inspired me to set myself a goal of interpreting the Prusa build steps in the same style as a Lego or Meccano instruction manual. &nbsp;This was also partly prompted by the call to arms in the reprap.org <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapWiki:Community_portal#Documentation" target="_blank">Community Portal</a> to produce documentation that lowers the (already quite low) barrier to entry even further.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The front page</p><p><a href="/reprap/prusa-mendel-visual-instructions/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-166  " title="The front page" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/FrontPage-231x300.png" alt="The front page" width="231" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>The original <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa" target="_blank">instructions on the wiki</a> are already clear and easy to follow, so the text from each step is simply copied verbatim. &nbsp;This document is deemed to be a supplement to them, and perhaps will help people with less, or no, mechanical background grasp what is involved in building a reprap, or stop a few mistakes from being made during a build (as I did - embarrassingly&nbsp;having to rebuild the front rods a couple of times due to misreading the diagram - which, of course, now seem clear with hindsight :)) &nbsp;Regardless, I had fun putting it together and learnt a but about SketchUp (and the Mendel) in the process.</p>

<p>A sample of the content</p><p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sample.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-167" title="A sample of the content" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sample-300x194.png" alt="A sample of the content" width="300" height="194" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guide is available in PDF format and in&nbsp;several sizes from the start page:&nbsp;<a href="/reprap/prusa-mendel-visual-instructions/">Prusa Mendel Visual Instructions</a>. &nbsp;The document was put together in Microsoft Publisher and this, together with the SketchUp model I created, is available as a <a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/prusa_mendel_visual_instructions" target="_blank">github project</a> for people to fork and use as they wish. &nbsp;There is also an <a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/prusa_mendel_visual_instructions/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a> to take bugs and suggestions.</p>

    was very expensive. Then I literally lost my tape-sheet ^^ and wanted to look
    for an alternative. Since there was some success with sylgard I wanted to try
    that and then found this: http://www.ebay.de/itm/270776478062?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649\r\n\r\nI

    Hi Rob,  I've only used freesteel a few times, and so far all my models have been symmetrical so I have not yet encountered the problem you describe.  If I get a chance I will slice a model tonight to see if I can recreate it.

    your way, taking advantage of a well known platform RAMPS or pursue this way?

    Hi Danny,

    Well, the beauty of using something like RAMPS is that it's tried and tested, and there's plenty of  firmware options.  The downside is that it may be more than you really need (I used it as it was lying here as a spare to my Prusa).  If you're wanting to drive more than one motor (e.g. for a tilt mechanism), or utilise the mosfets (for example I used them to make a little experimental heated bath to thin the resin) then a RAMPS (or similar) is a useful thing to have.

    If you just want to drive a Z axis then all you really need is a stepper motor, a driver, and an arduino (or if you're au fait with PIC's then perhaps that's an option).  Just buying these components would be a bit cheaper than shelling out for a full board, such as the 4PI.  You could wire up the stepper driver to the arduino and make sure the pin assignment is correct in the firmware.  Go for a arduino clone, and stepsticks instead of pololu and it's be even cheaper.

    I use this <a href="http://www.zappautomation.co.uk/en/nema-17-stepper-motors/373-sy42sth47-1684a-high-torque-hybrid-stepper-motors.html" rel="nofollow">NEMA 17</a> from zapp automation, and <a href="http://xyzprinters.com/components/189-pololu-1182-a4988-stepper-driver.html" rel="nofollow">pololu A4983 drivers</a> from XYZ and I have both an Ardunio Mega (also from XYZ) and an Arduino clone, both of which work fine. Have a look also at <a href="http://reprapworld.com" rel="nofollow">reprapworld</a>

    As you are no doubt aware, there are plenty of options, and it's definitely worth scouting around to get the best price.  Hope that helps - feel free to ping back any further questions.

    Cheers,
    Gary

    Hi Danny,

    You're quite correct in that skeinforge has to be installed in order to be used from Printrun.  I actually don't slice from within Printrun myself, instead I use <a href="http://slic3r.org/" rel="nofollow">Slic3r</a> to generate the SVG file.  If you're not wanting to install python then perhaps it's worth you having a look at this instead.  It's written in perl, but it's available as a precompiled package on Windows, Linux & MacOS.

    My DLP printer is currently in hibernation as I simply have too many other things going on at the moment. But I will be starting it up again soon (I hope).  And I will be sure to post something about it once I do.

    Cheers,
    Gary

    actually reconfigured my printer to try top-down as well, and I got more complete

    the 11A unconnected?\r\nI've tested the software with the firmware and it seems
    ok (with no power or motor connected) but there is no LED feedback to see if a
    stepper pulse has been given. Is this correct?\r\n\r\n(I'm a bit carefull here

    printer).  Considering the board will only be driving a couple or so steppers
    I think just the 5A will be fine.\r\n\r\nAnd you're correct: there is no LED feedback

    Hi Henry,  I did try the PTFE spray but with no success sadly.  The problem being that it isn't really "trocken" enough, and wiped off after a few exposures.

    At this stage I would recommend either trying Sylgard, as others have had success with this, or the PTFE sheet.  But I strongly recommend getting as thick a sheet as you can afford. The ones I bought originally do not last very long - all it takes is a slight tear as you take off a part and the base can be ruined.  I have since bought some thicker sheet, but not yet found time to test them out.

    Best of luck!

    Hi Danny,  Nice work on the X9's.  Regarding UV LEDs, The only thing I can say is that when I was looking for them, the ones with the correct wavelength, and useful power, were really expensive.  And whether or not such an LED could be installed in the projector I really can't say - I'd have to recommend looking/asking on either the the Yahoo group (http://tech.dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/diy_3d_printing_and_fabrication), or the RepRap forum (http://forums.reprap.org). This wiki might have some info too: http://3dprinter.wikidot.com/dlp-projectors

    Hi Danny,

    How comfortable are you with running the idea of installing Python (2.7) and trying to run printrun from source?  I might be able to find time to recompile a package for XP, but I can't promise anything.  Running from source would be the quickest option for you at the moment.

    Hi Danny,

    There's something we could try before you try installing python and all the dependencies.  Instead, you could try installing the Windows runtime files that the printrun exectuable needs from here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582  Download and run the vcredist_x86.exe file and it should install the required dll files onto your laptop.  Then try the printrun executable again - if it still complains then try deleting the folder called "Microsoft.VC90.CRT" which is in te same directory as pronterface.exe.

    If that still fails then we can try running from source,  Instructions for installing python and the dependencies on windows are here: https://github.com/garyhodgson/Printrun#windows-1 and the source can be downloaded as a zip from here: https://github.com/garyhodgson/Printrun/archive/experimental.zip

    Feel free to switch to email as this may need a bit of back and forth to get done - contact@garyhodgson.com

    Cheers,

    I show the first slice of a project it shows significantly smaller. In the beginning
    I didn't notice this because everything was uncalibrated, but now it is a real
    issue. \r\nWhen I look into the SVG file created by slic3r it shows for an object
    of x=20 y=23 z=11 the following: svg width=\"20\" height=\"23\". Loaded in Projectlayer
    it shows a height of 11 mm so on paper it all seems to be ok. \r\nWhen I present
    it, the real (onscreen) dimensions are x=17 and y=20, the measured height of the

    upscaling only seems to work in whole numbers (from 1x to 2x for instance)\r\nI'm
    sure it isn't a hardware related problem, nor windows related because on diff.
    machines under diff. versions of windows it makes no difference. Even the windows

<p>I recently changed tack. &nbsp;Instead of pursuing a powder printer design I decided to focus my energy on building a DLP resin printer. Once I had considered what my end goals really were I came to the conclusion that the powder approach would not yield the resolution and quality I would want. &nbsp;Looking over the blogs and forum posts in the 3D printing community I suspect several people have followed a similar line of reasoning. &nbsp;There is also a growing interest in this type of printer amongst the 3D printer community and so I imagine a better chance for &nbsp;support.</p>

<p>This post, and presumably subsequent ones, will attempt to document what I have achieved so far, outline the issues such a printer has, and how I intend to tackle them. As is often the case, everything I write about has already been done before in some way or another, but hopefully this account will add to the shared experience. &nbsp;I have to caveat that my goal here is purely fun and education, I'm not trying to develop a product, or even a guide on how to build your own version of this. It's all quite hacked together, as will become apparent! Still, I will still make all files and designs available in case they prove to be useful.</p>

<p>I should also say that it's very early days and whilst I have had a couple of "successful" prints, my definition of success here is purposely quite flexible! &nbsp;There's a lot to do, not least calibrating for dimensional accuracy, repeatability and robustness.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>Here I run through the various parts that make up the printer. Future posts will no doubt go into more detail for each one, but this should give a good idea of what I have done so far.</p>

<h3>Frame</h3>

<p>My initial idea was to build the frame with wood but I soon changed my mind for <a href="http://www.alu-profil-technik.de/product_info.php?info=p14_profil-20-x-20-nut-6.html">20mm aluminium profile</a> for the flexibility it would give. Additionally, I picked up various brackets and small steel sheet parts from the local hardware store and my scrap pile to hold things in place. The remaining parts were printed on the Mendel, with the majority of the design coming <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19185">ScribbleJ's Thingiverse entry</a>, but with a few parts modified to fit the aluminium profiles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>The Frame</small></p>
</p>

<p>I swapped the motor coupling for a thrust bearing design, in order to reduce wobble, and changed the arm that drops into the vat to a modular design using threaded rods and a custom base. &nbsp;The Z axis is so high simply due to the rods I had lying around being that length. &nbsp;The middle sketchup design shows an alternative where the bulk of the Z-axis goes below the vat table, but this introduces more parts and a potential source for more wobble.</p>

<h3>Vat</h3>

<p>I can already foresee that this component will undergo many revisions. The interaction between the vat floor and the layer of resin being activated by the UV light is critical, and subject to much discussion on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/diy_3d_printing_and_fabrication">yahoo forum</a>. As I will detail below, already my initial version quickly developed problems and has had to be rebuilt. But for reference, in version 1 I used off cut aluminium extrusions for the walls and 2mm thick perspex (acrylic) for the base. On top of the base, secured between it and the walls, is a <a href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/insulation-films/5363980">PTFE film</a> layer (<a href="http://docs-europe.electrocomponents.com/webdocs/065a/0900766b8065a8bd.pdf">PDF data sheet</a>). The whole thing was made water-tight with standard transparent silicon caulk.</p>

<h3>Resin</h3>
<p>The key component which, to date, has impeded DIY DLP resin printers due to it's exorbitant cost. However, this is already changing. I bought 1kg of Spot-GP resin from <a href="http://spotamaterials.com/">spotamaterials</a> here in Europe for ~&euro;85 (+&euro;35 shipping to Germany). Still way more expensive than materials for FDM printing, but I imagine prices will drop over time as they did with PLA filament.</p>
<h3>Projector</h3>

<p>This is perhaps a tricky component to acquire as there are so many options open and one wants to be sure of getting the right one. After several days of hunting on Ebay, local classifieds and even Amazon, I lucked-out and found an InFocus IN2104 on Ebay which I picked up for &euro;170.</p>

<p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/InFocus-IN2104.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1066" title="InFocus-IN2104" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/InFocus-IN2104.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>
<p><small>InFocus IN2104</small></p>
</p>

<p>The most important feature is that the projector has to be one with DLP technology! LCD projectors filter the necessary UV light and appear simply not to work. The next key properties I looked for were the wattage of the bulb and the native resolution. My initial plan was to get one with 800x600 resolution, but I changed my criteria to a higher resolution for the simple fact that I could imagine soon wanting higher definition in my prints (it affects the X/Y resolution of course) and would be kicking myself if I had to buy another projector after 6 months. The IN2104&nbsp;has a resolution of 1024x768.</p>

<p>I considered bulb wattage a more important factor than the lumen rating as it seems the lumen values given by various manufacturers varies considerably, and I got the feeling, after reading many reviews, that the lumen value is not very dependable. Saying that, higher lumen is generally better, but also look at the bulb wattage. The InFocus has a 200W bulb. Most projectors I looked up had values around 180W, particularly Acer, and so the exact value will depend on the brand and model. I set myself the hard criteria of type and resolution, and then was a bit more flexible on bulb wattage, price and availability.</p>

<h3>Base</h3>

<p>The part which the first layer attaches to and, in my case, rises up from the resin. My initial tests were with wood and then perspex because I had no local source of glass pieces, which seems to be the preferred material. These proved unsuccessful and so I tried a couple of other materials I had lying around. It seems that copper PCB board and stripboard work quite well. With the latter allowing the resin to harden within the holes and potentially provide a better grip - but this is only a hypothesis. I shall no doubt replace this in the future revisions, but it provides a cheap starting point.</p>

<p>The board is simply glued to a small 3D printed piece which allows four PCB stand-offs to be attached. These provide the lift over the rim of the vat. The stand-offs are then screwed to another 3D printed part which in turn goes on the vertical Z-axis rods. Over the stand-offs are stiff springs - these allow each corner to be individually adjusted so that the base is parallel with the vat floor.</p>

<p>
    <a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC05153.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1058" title="Base" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC05153-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

</p>


<p>Whilst using threaded rods for the vertical Z-axis was handy because I had some around, I think these will soon be replaced with an L-bracket design as there is some flex in the rods. The weight of the model is negligible, but the suction force of the part and the vat floor can be considerable and it is therefore a design goal to reduce flex where it is not wanted.</p>

<h3>Lens Throw Reducer</h3>

<p>The shortest distance the projector can throw, and be in focus, is approximately 35cm (if I remember correctly). One could possibly open the projector and physically modify the focus mechanism, or lens, in order to reduce the throw (as Mike has done with his <a href="http://b9creator.com/">B9Creator</a>), but I'm wary of making modifications to the projector itself and so opted to use a cheap magnifying glass to do the job. This choice has obvious disadvantages - optical distortion, inconsistent image placement, etc - but it's cheap and it works fine during the initial phase.</p>

<h3>Resin Delivery</h3>

<p>I expected to have to design a resin delivery system - perhaps something as simple as an upside-down bottle with a tube to the vat floor, with the liquid pressure regulating the delivery - and I may still do this. In the meantime the vat holds enough resin to complete my small test prints, and I load the resin via a large syringe.</p>
<h3>Host</h3>
<p>I am using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/Printrun/tree/experimental">Printrun</a>,&nbsp;adding the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the presentation window fullscreen in a second monitor.</li>
<li>Project a calibration grid</li>
<li>Display the first layer of the model - useful for displaying the first layer longer than the subsequent layers.</li>
<li>Accept SVG from Slic3r. (<strong>Update: </strong>To do this I replaced the SVG module with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wxpsvg">wxpsvg</a> which has a dependency on <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/">pyparsing</a>. &nbsp;Install instructions are on the pyparsing site.)</li>
<li>Accept a set images (bmp, png, jpg) in a zip file (with suffix .3dlp.zip so it's recognisable but can also be opened in a regular archive program).</li>

<h3>Firmware</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter"> Sprinter</a> for it's ease of hacking.</p>

<h3>Post Cure</h3>

<p>I'm not 100% sure how necessary post-curing is. The parts appear quite stable directly after coming off the base. A bath in isopropyl alcohol may suffice for post-processing, to remove non-cured resin. However, as I had a UV lamp handy I threw the parts under that for a few minutes.</p>

<p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC05187.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1049" title="Post Curing" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC05187-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The following are a few random notes and findings as I got to print #1.</p>
<p>As the resin photo-initiates the reaction is very exothermic. A very quick test with the thermocouple of my multi-meter and a drop of resin on a thin clear plastic sheet in the bright sun produced a temperature change from 23&deg;C to 74&deg;C. This may have been a contributing factor to the demise of my first vat bottom, which I discuss below. 74&deg;C won't burn too much, but it's definitely worth considering - particularly if you get some on your skin and then walk into the sunlight! So be careful! I use latex surgery gloves when testing as the resin tends to get everywhere.</p>
<p>I used a RAMPS board and the related reprap firmware largely because it was lying around. There are a few alternatives as well as the option to roll your own of course. Chris Marion has put together a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/3dlp-host-software">python based Host</a> which works with the <a href="http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page">Firmata firmware</a>. It's currently in beta and windows only, but worth considering. &nbsp;Chris's software uses <a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/slicer">freesteel</a> to produce png slices - this is also worth playing with, although it's not open-source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><small>Belt Pulley</small></p>
</p>

<p>The initial successful test pieces came out well partly by luck - the model's design is such that even though the exposure times per layer were slightly too long this only reinforced previous overlapping layers directly above. I attempted a more complex print soon after and the exposure times resulted in a solid block of resin where it should have been a mesh of struts within. A standard technique to bring more control over the exposure times is to add a coloured pigment to the resin (between 0.2% and 2% by weight according to Fernando at spotamaterials). Currently I am testing the resin without a dye until I order some. My very unscientific initial tests seemed to show an exposure time of 1 second will harden ~0.1mm of resin - but I have to caveat that there are many factors which can play a part, not least of which is my my poor process. I shall endeavour to produce more reliable figures in the near future.</p>
<p>The adhesive properties of the resin are not the only force to contend with. The bottom-up approach has the added problem of a vacuum force - just as with a suction cup. There are several ways to overcome this: brute force (not recommended of course), tilt mechanisms, and slide mechanisms. At the moment the printer simply pulls up, and because the parts are quite small, in comparison with the forces involved, the parts are forcefully pulled vertically off the vat floor. This obviously will have to change, and in fact a subsequent test print nicely highlights this interesting failure:</p>

<p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_8477.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1055" title="Deformed Print" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_8477-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>

<p>This should be a cube with a sphere coming out of one edge. The sphere is deformed due to the 'top' of the cube sticking to the vat floor, from vacuum force, for several slices. Either the vat floor, the Z-axis rods, or the something else, flexed sufficiently to allow the part to remain attached, until the force was overcome, and could continue. One way of resolving this would be to adjust the print cycle so that the Z-axis rises several millimetres at the end of an exposure, and then lowers to the next slice height. However this would likely only defer the problem until later, larger prints, where the vacuum force would be greater. I think I will introduce a tilt mechanism as part of the next iteration.</p>
<h2>Vat Failure</h2>
<p>Soon after my initial test prints the perspex vat bottom developed some cracks in the middle, which developed to the point of failure. Prior to this a deformation had appeared at a spot after I had exposed for several seconds (whilst attempting to get the resin to adhere to the base). The autopsy showed that this deformation was mainly in the perspex, and slightly in the PTFE film.</p>
<p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_8494.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1053" title="Cracked Vat" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_8494-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_8488.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1054" title="Cracked Vat 2" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_8488-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I had done quite a poor job of positioning the bolt holes, and consequently, as I tightened the bolts, slight cracks appears at the holes. Therefore I think it is safe to assume that the entire vat bottom was under some lateral pressure, which may very well have contributed to the overall failure. I also had chosen to use only 2mm thick perspex which could also play a part.</p>
<p>The next iteration has a 4mm thick base and I took much more care to align the bolt holes. I expect a similar failure with this version too, but will hopefully be able to test some more whilst I design iteration 3.</p>
<p>As an aside - as I was writing this post and gathering links and facts I came across an <a href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/precison-lubricants/7577134/">anti-friction dry PTFE lubricant</a> from WD-40 (<a href="http://www.wd40specialist.co.uk/pdf/WD40%20Dry%20PTFE%20Lubricant%20UK%20-%20TDS.pdf">PDF&nbsp;Data Sheet</a>) which may be worth investigating. It would certainly simplify vat construction! One could simply use a Pyrex dish and spray some PTFE in before each print run. (Of course that's a bit glib - I suspect oven dishes won't have the optical clarity required!)</p>

  content: Why doesn't the prusa just attach the motors from beneath with a gear like
    how the old mendel does it?  Whats the benefit? This coupling broke, I dont see
    it as reliable.

  content: I had a similar problem. I managed to break a Z coupler. I manageg a quick
    bodge repair witha cigarette lighter. Heating both faces and applying them together
    got me going again. Obviously my next print was two spare z couplers. They are
    still spare, my bodge repair is still holding out.......

<p>Not only did my 0.5mm hot end block completely, but using too much force whilst it was mounted broke a Z-axis coupling!  By luck I had printed a spare just a day earlier.</p>
<p>[ Edit 27.4.11:&nbsp;I should clarify - I was putting too much pressure on the entire x carriage as I was trying to push through some blocked filament by hand ]</p>

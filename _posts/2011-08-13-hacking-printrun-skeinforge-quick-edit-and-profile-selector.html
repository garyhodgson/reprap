<div>I recently <a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/Printrun">forked</a> <a href="https://github.com/kliment/Printrun">Kliment's Printrun</a> and added a couple of features that others will perhaps find handy. &nbsp;One of these has been pulled back into the original project, but is modified to use <a href="https://github.com/ahmetcemturan/SFACT">SFACT</a> rather than the original Skeinforge. &nbsp;In case people would prefer to use the full Skeinforge I will outline the modifications here.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>The first mod is a Quick Edit screen for the currently active Skeinforge profile. This shows what I think are some key settings all on one page, and thus saves opening Skeinforge and hunting though the tabs.</div>

<div><a rel="attachment wp-att-700" href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23h11_07.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-700" title="2011-08-13 23h11_07" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23h11_07-300x258.png" alt="" width="300" height="258" /></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The second mod is having the ability to change profile from a menu list within Printrun.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div><a rel="attachment wp-att-699" href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23h10_22.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-699" title="2011-08-13 23h10_22" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-13-23h10_22-300x215.png" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>So far these seem to work on my setup - but please backup any important profiles before giving this version a go.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The modified version is at <a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/Printrun">https://github.com/garyhodgson/Printrun</a>.</div>

  content: "I'm in the middle of building my first RepRap, using eMaker Huxley metric
    printed parts and adapting them to work with SAE hardware, and am planning on
    doing something much like you've done with your RoxRap once I'm able to print
    parts on my own. Would you consider putting it on Thingiverse at some point?\r\n\r\nI
    also love your visual instructions and wish there was a set for the Huxley, since
    it's a bit of a chore for a newbie to sort out all the parts needed from the available
    instructions. Once I'm done building my Huxley, I might try doing one myself.
    (I see the Romscraj bunch did their Portabee manual in a similar style as well.)"

    Hey Tad,  The RoxRap was really thrown together from various designs I came across, and I think now I would base my design off a eMaker (or RepRapPro, are they the same?) Huxley.  As such I don't think there is anything I can post on Thingiverse that would be of use, particularly as I never got it printing as well as my Mendel.  It was really just a test bed for various ideas I had.

    If you do have a go at creating some visual instructions then I highly recommend using Sketchup - it makes making the images pretty straightforward.  If I was going to do them again I think I would make it a web-site instead of using Publisher, and then creating a PDF from the site.

    Best of luck with your build!

<p>A nice way of ending a productive weekend: &nbsp;The Huxley-class printer I have been working on produces it's first print!</p>

<p>Designated "Roxrap", after the various parts used that were salvaged from an old Xerox laser printer, this is my first printer produced from my Prusa. It's a mish-mash of the existing Huxley/Mini-Mendel designs (eMaker, TechZone, Mini-Mendel &amp; the RepRap Huxley) plus some parts I designed myself. &nbsp;It will be the printer where I can experiment with designs without fear of suddenly having no printer available if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>The first print, a 20mm cube, is absolutely terrible of course. &nbsp;There is much&nbsp;calibration&nbsp;to be done: the frame wobbles, the X carriage shifts, the extruder drive is inconsistent and incorrectly configured, but the fact that it produced something without blowing up is a win for me.</p>

  content: Very cool. I've been wanting to experiment with this floating gear concept,
    but seeing it in action makes me want to try it more! I think this setup really
    could come into its own when extended to two extruders. I look forward to it see
    how well it works out during actual extruding when the friction is at its greatest.
    I guess if that's a problem you can just keep upping the motor size until it is
    not.

  content: That is so awesome! I definitely want to do that on my RepRap at some point.
    As it is, I'm already nearly done with some other upgrades that I've been working
    on for a couple weeks now. Maybe I'll shoot for the next maintenance cycle. Good
    work!

  content: "Really enjoy this concept and your test rig is awesome, you do some good
    work on it.\r\n\r\nI agree it would very interesting to see how a herringbone
    gear would cope with the lateral forces. I think perhaps herringbone gear with
    flanges would be a safe bet.\r\n\r\nIf you had the large driven gear with two
    flanges that would help keep the small driving gear in place, but printing a gear
    with two flanges would be tricky because of the overhang.\r\n\r\nYou could instead
    have one flange on the driven gear, and one flange on the driver gear. With the
    flanges on opposite sides to each other. This way you would be constrained in
    both directions with both flanges and herringbone with all printed parts.\r\n\r\nHow
    is the friction on the driving gear as it slides along that square rod? I had
    a cursory look for square bushings and came up with this: http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/234284591/Plastic_Square_Bushing.html\r\n\r\nKeep
    up the awesome work!"

  content: Cool idea, though it would be nice to move the gearing off the carriage
    too so that you have even less weight and so that the square shaft moves slow
    (might cause less wear). You would need a drive gear machined to fit the square
    shaft, but out drive gears need to be machined anyway, and metal (or PTFE, or
    other machined material) bushing interfacing the gear to the square rod. If the
    drive gear uses a groove hobbed with a tap as we do with bolts, the drive gear
    should keep itself centered on the filament.

    That's an interesting idea.  I just had a dig around my junk box and found some interesting one-way bushings that could be used together (either direction) to hold a hobbed insert in place around a round rod, but leave it free to move along it.  Or, using a hobbed insert with a round hole with four corners drilled out might work, but would have to be pretty precise.  If I get a chance I'll put together a proof of concept, or at least draw what I mean :)

    Also, one could probably go to the extreme and remove all motors from the entire X-axis - using a bevel or worm gear to change the operating angle by 90&deg; to drive the extruder, and perhaps using something like the <a href="http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2011/09/experimental-off-carriage-x-axis/" rel="nofollow">off-carriage x-axis design</a> I played with.  Perhaps such a design would be useful for your printrbot variant to remove all weight from the Z rods?

  content: "Hi Sanjay - Alternating flanges is a good idea for holding the gears in
    place without a bracket!\r\n\r\nThe drive gear is printed out of PLA and has reasonably
    little friction so it slides quite well.  If I was to make another iteration I
    would provide more support for the rod and the bracket - possibly with bearings.
    \ Using brass square-bushings would extend the life of the gear I guess."

  content: Actually, my design needs MORE weight on the Z rods. The x axis rests on
    top of the nuts as a safety feature (like the Cupcake's Z platform, so the axis
    will lift in case of a head collision), but it's so light that the idler end has
    a habit of sticking on the rod and lagging behind the other end when it's going
    down. Putting the extruder motor on the idler end would balance it out and solve
    this problem.

  content: Great job. This is an idea I also had but ultimately I went a different
    route because I was worried about friction along the square shaft while both motors
    are in motion. Instead I used a differentially driven belt. So far my idea is
    just a design though I'd like to test it as soon as possible. You can see my design

    bushing made of brass (or bronze) will do the job...\r\nall in all i think it
    is an interesting idea but i guess it makes the build quite a bit more comples
    (and a rectangular rod will be necessary as \"vitamin\" part). Despite this, keep

  content: If you move the idler at the end of the square bar so that it is on the
    extruder carriage, just to the right of the driver gear so that it is attached
    to the carriage, and allow the square bar to slide through the bearing, you would
    not have to worry about the driver gear pulling away because of the rod bowing.
    You would need a square-to-round insert with low friction on the square side (maybe
    4 "U" shaped brass inserts covering the inner square edges) that fits nicely into
    the round bearings' inside. The end of the square would then just need a very
    loose round hole, just to stop it from rattling around.

  content: Hi Enrico,  you're quite correct!  I recently spent a few minutes hooking
    this up to a hot-end and attempting to extrude, and indeed the square rod bowed
    too much when under pressure.  This is purely because my implementation is poorly
    cobbled together - a more solid housing for the driven gear, as you suggest, would
    solve the problem.  Interestingly, my initial go at this involved a square-to-round
    insert for a 608 bearing - but I had attempted to make the insert and drive gear
    in one piece, and my print didn't fit well enough.  If I find time I will give
    your suggestion a go.

  content: "Hi Gary,\r\n\r\nI'm glad my Idea had merit - and I like yours even better!
    I was initially going to suggest a bearing on each side of the drive gear to hold
    it rock-steady, but thought that might be over-kill. Even worse, with 3 thin separate
    points of contact, each of which could potentially tilt off-plane as they are
    shuttled back and forth, you could end up with binding issues.\r\n\r\nWith the
    drive gear affixed to the square-to-round insert, the gear is stronger due to
    the extra material. Also, the contact area of the square rod through the square
    hole is longer, which will make the whole thing more stable in the plane normal
    to the rod. Depending on the space requirements, you might even extend the square-to-round
    insert to the left of the gear, as if you were going to put another bearing on
    that side, but just for stability."

  content: "Gary. The design looks like it has a future. As suggested above, shaft
    driving the large extruder gear is the next logical step, but how about a step
    further. Drive the hobbed bolt directly. A larger diameter hobbed bolt with a
    square hole. Then a bearing either side with the square shaft passing right through.
    All gearing at the end of the X carriage. The extruder would be tiny.\r\n\r\nSquare
    holes are hard to find, but brass keys for venting domestic radiators have them.
    An alternative would be to use a heaxgon drive bar and use a modified hexagon
    socket with the outsided roughed up with a dremel to grip the filament. (cheap
    socket sets found for &pound;2 at petrol stations!). Another source would be the
    to use the head of a socket cap screw."

    Hi Johan,

    That looks great and I can't wait to see it built and in action!  Do you have a blog or something I can follow the progress on?

    I always wanted to develop the idea beyond the proof of concept phase, but getting it higher in my to-do list has proven difficult, so it will be great to see a real implementation.

    One idea I have been playing around with since then which might be of interest is a way to use one motor for two extruders.  It uses 2 one-way ring bearings, running in opposite directions to each other.  (I can sketch the design if you like.)  Each bearing would be within a gear driving an extruder.  The main problem of course is that there would be no way to retract the filament using the motor.  I thought perhaps a spring pushing back on the filament might be used as an alternative, but haven't mocked up anything beyond the ring bearings. Maybe it's just another silly idea, but if it could be made to work then it would allow for 4 extruders on your machine :)

    Anyhow, I hope you will keep me up to date with your progress!

    Best of luck,
    Gary

    on the norwegian reprap forum, but nothing much.\r\nI had to redesign and reprint
    the x-ends, and part of the frame.\r\nThe way the hex rods are fixed in the bearings
    in the x ends isn't as rigid as the smooth rods in normal x ends. I had to go
    from one to two z smoothrods to avoid the x-ends rotating....\r\n\r\nJohan"

<p>There was a recent thing on Thingiverse called the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15132">Vert-X-Belt-Truder</a> by Johann which describes a way of moving the extruder motor off the carriage. The benefits are a lighter, and potentially faster, carriage. The Bowden cable is another way of achieving this goal. A comment by Martin Price (martinprice2004) caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote><p>...keep the x axis as current prusa, but turn the extruder 90 degree around the z axis. Drive the extruder using a motor mounted at the end of the axis with a square or hexagon bar mounted horizontally. The extruder drive gear moves along the shaft when the x axis moves, but can still be driven by the motor at any point.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had already done something similar for moving the <a title="Experimental Off-Carriage X-Axis" href="{% post_url 2011-09-27-experimental-off-carriage-x-axis %}">X-axis motor off the carriage</a> and so I quickly threw together a proof of concept to thrash out how a design would work.</p>

<p>
  <a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Prusa-Mendel-Off-Carriage-Extruder-PoC-MattRobertsCompactExtruder.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-935" title="Off Carriage Extruder PoC - Matt Roberts Compact Extruder" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Prusa-Mendel-Off-Carriage-Extruder-PoC-MattRobertsCompactExtruder-300x189.png" alt="" width="300" height="189" /></a>
  <p><small>Sketchup Design</small></p>
</p>

<p>The results are shown in the following video (please excuse the varying focus, the many "er"s, and the fact the audio is muffled between 2:10 and 3:35 - I didn't realise I had my finger on the microphone - but I don't say much of value here anyhow, only that it seems to work and the drive gear moves through the drive shaft. Also that the test "print" is running at 200mm/s (travel:250mm/s))</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4h8N3RZUSvQ" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>

<p>I utilised the <a href="http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2011/04/building-matt-roberts-compact-geared-extruder/">Compact Geared Extruder by Matt Roberts</a> (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7467">Thingiverse</a>) because it's small, modular, and as it is designed in OpenScad it's easy to hack with. I went through a couple of iterations to come up with a bracket that would hold the drive gear in place as the extruder moved along the square drive shaft. As I put the parts together I realised the same effect could be achieved using herringbone gears, so long as the drive gear is held close to the driven. The coupling is a rubber roller from an old Xerox laser printer, as is the square rod. The NEMA 11 motor is simply zip-tied to the X-axis motor end, and the idler is simply a bearing zip-tied to the X-axis Idler end.</p>

<p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Drive-Gear-Bracket-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-946"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-946" title="Drive Gear Bracket 2" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Drive-Gear-Bracket-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>

<p>
A few things I learned as I put it together which might be worth considering if anyone recreates this.</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Positioning of the motor and idler dictate where the drive gear will be placed, and so I would align these precisely with the X-axis rods and place the drive gear with a bracket. Then I would make position of the extruder flexible (using slots for the bolts for example) so it can be accurately pushed back in line with the drive gear, giving a good fit.</li>
<li>The bracket holding the drive gear would be made more robust - reducing lateral movement and possibly adding bearings or bushings either side of the drive gear to support the rod.</li>
<li>The bracket should have a way of removing and inserting the square rod, otherwise it'll be a pain to disassemble the whole thing. Of course if bearing or bushings are used then it might be easier to design it so the rod slides out along the X-axis when disassembling.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, using a helical gear such as a herringbone might remove the need for a bracket at all. I guess this would depend on the amount of flex along the driveshaft, and whether the drive gear keeps engaged during the back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I get chance to fix the hobbed bolt of the compact extruder then I will try to get this setup printing for real. Here's a couple more photos and videos just of the running.</p>

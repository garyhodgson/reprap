<p>After several attempts at printing a usable pulley I <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?154,81153">threw a question into the forum</a> to see if there was anything I was missing.</p>
<p>Either the pulley spurs are too wide (<a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110419-DSC04094.jpg">top right</a> image in the gallery below), and so the belt teeth rides up on them, or the spurs are unstable and a mess (<a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110419-DSC04095.jpg">row 2, left</a>), plus the spindle doesn't fit on the motor.</p>
<p>The suggestions and information from the forum was good - my Skeinforge settings needed more calibrating (note: use 100mm of feedstock for measuring the throughput, not 10mm), and nophead told me that the motor spindles are expected to be reamed.</p>
<p>So just as I start producing what looks like usable results, the <a title="I hate Mondays&hellip;" href="http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2011/04/i-hate-mondays/">hot end blocked and I broke the Z axis coupling</a>. &nbsp;So I loaded up the 0.35mm hot end to see if I can get better results with that. &nbsp;Having a smaller nozzle brings it's own problems: you have to be more precise in your positioning (particularly with the Z axis), and the cohesion between layers seems to be trickier to maintain. &nbsp;After some fiddling in Skeinforge I was producing reasonable quality prints (<a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110419-DSC04096.jpg">row 2,right</a>), and my test pulley prints started to fit the belt much easier (<a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110419-DSC04099.jpg">row 3, left</a>, this is <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7218">Greg's modified pulley</a>). &nbsp;However the layer quality was still pretty messy (<a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110419-DSC04101.jpg">row 3, right</a>). &nbsp;More playing in Skeinforge started to yield better results (<a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110421-DSC04110.jpg">row 4</a>), by also reducing the speed in repsnapper when the print reached the spurs (even though feed and flow was already set to 15mm/s).</p>

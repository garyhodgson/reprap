<p>Got to print the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6713">Accessible Wade's Extruder by GregFrost</a> at the weekend. &nbsp;I thought I would be able to set it off and go and do some other work, but couldn't stop watching over it and being a bit nervous due to it's size and (relative) complexity.</p>
<p>Apart from the bridge over the bearing holders not holding up too well, and looking a bit scruffy due to some discoloured ooze, it came out quite well and I think it will be usable.</p>

</p>

<p>And then my hot end broke - as&nbsp;predicted by Robert Morrison a few days ago. &nbsp;Time to build the replacement, and order the parts for the new and improved version.</p>

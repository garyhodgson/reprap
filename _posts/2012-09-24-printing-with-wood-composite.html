  content: I really like the gradient wood color look. What size nozzle are you using?  Would
    a 0.35mm work?  What type of hot end?

  content: Hi, I'm using a 0.5mm nozzle with a homebrew, but standard, hotend (alu
    block, brass nozzle, peek insulator)  I guess a 0.35mm nozzle would work fine.  I
    always had problems with my 0.35mm and PLA, but I think that is due to the design
    more than anything.  I'm going to write up more on how the wood composite is to
    work with but I can say it is like slightly spongy PLA, and extrudes very easily
    at a range of temperatures. In fact it extrudes a little too easily and I had
    to modify my retract settings a little.

    the price has now gone up and it's now only 250g rolls :(\r\n\r\nMaybe we will
    have more sources soon and the price will lower again.\r\n\r\nCan it be dissolved
    in any way? for use as a support material?\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you run it at
    a much higher temperature? Any bubbles? I was wondering if you could make a wood-foam
    structure using elevated temp.\r\n\r\nI also wonder what other materials can be
    mixed with PLA...???"

  content: Hi Alfred, I just sent you an email with the details.  Basically both Tecnaro,
    and their supplier Albis, only supply granules in 25kg bags. So if the material
    is suitable one would have to order a lot, and then create the filament oneself.

  content: I just purchased some Laywoo-D3 1.75mm filament from Amazon and it works
    as you describe above. One thing that I noticed though is that the printed piece
    seems flexible, as if it needs to be cured. Did you have to let the prints dry
    out or cure them after printing at all?

    Hi Pierre,  Yes, the print is quite flexible directly after printing - I find it gets a little harder after a few hours, but it is definitely more flexible than PLA for example.

    I haven't heard of anyone "curing" it at all.  Although I am tempted to find some food-safe polyurethane paint to paint the prints with.

    All the best,
    Gary

<p>The recent articles (<a href="http://www.3ders.org/articles/20120920-laywoo-d3-new-fdm-filament-can-print-wood-with-tree-rings.html">3ders</a>, <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30552">Thingiverse</a>) about printing with "wood" piqued my interest, and I was excited to see the GRRF sells 0.5kg rolls. It seems I submitted my order in time because they are now out of stock - but taking pre-orders. The filament arrived today and I got a chance to make a test print - the trusty, if now unoriginal, minimug.</p>
<p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/20120924-DSC05315.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1201" title="Wood Minimug" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/20120924-DSC05315-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a></p>
<p>The GRRF page and the original Thingiverse entry by Kaipa state that it's warp-free and requires no heated bed, so I gave this a try and true enough it printed out perfectly. The hot-end was set to 190&deg;C at the start, and I manually increased the temperature in 10&deg; increments to 220&deg;C back and forth to produce the&nbsp;colour&nbsp;gradient.</p>

<p>The bottom of the print is smooth, similar to the finish from PLA, whereas the sides and top are rougher. So far I haven't attempted working with it (drilling, cutting, etc), which I will try tomorrow. I did try a little sanding which required a bit more effort than real wood and again was similar to working with PLA. I'll be interested to see how well it takes paints and lacquers.</p>
<p>I find this development pretty exciting as it opens up another material that works immediately with a reprap FDM printer. Kaipa isn't revealing what is in the composite, nor his process, but Viktor from the forums <a href="http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,155749,155785#msg-155785">pointed out</a> &nbsp;a material from Tecnaro called <a href="http://www.tecnaro.de/english/arboform.htm?section=arboform">Arboform</a>. This thermoplastic composite is based on Lignin, a natural polymer, which is a by-product of the pulp industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Mixing lignin with natural fibres (flax, hemp or other fibre plants) and some natural additive produces a fibre composite that can be processed at raised temperatures and, just like a synthetic thermoplastic material, can be made into mouldings, plates or slabs on conventional plastics processing machines."</p></blockquote>
<p>What's also really interesting is seeing the other products from Tecnaro: <a href="http://www.tecnaro.de/english/arbofill.htm?section=arbofill">Arbofill</a> and <a href="http://www.tecnaro.de/english/arboblend.htm?section=arboblend">Arboblend</a>. The latter having comparable properties to ABS, apparently.</p>
<p>I believe Tecnaro only sells granules, and cater for manufacturers, as their minimum order quantity is 25kg (1 bag) but considering the recent arrival of filament extruders (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30642">Lyman</a>, <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24583">Filabot</a>) it seems it would be a perfect match for the 3D printing community. Anyone in Germany (Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg) want to split a 25kg bag with me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>... and of course the minimug was watertight!</p>

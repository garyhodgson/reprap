<p>With the recent announcement from Prusa about the new version of his Mendel design I thought it would be worthwhile to share a webpage I created that compares the stl files from the two versions: <a href="http://garyhodgson.com/prusadiff">http://garyhodgson.com/prusadiff</a></p>

<p><a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-12-14h40_28.png" rel="attachment wp-att-847"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-847" title="2011-11-12 14h40_28" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-12-14h40_28-1024x575.png" alt="" width="620" height="348" /></a></p>

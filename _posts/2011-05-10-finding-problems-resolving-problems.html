  content: I find your site very helpful. Special thanks for visual instructions on
    Wade's extruder. I am building Prusa too but having problems with electronics.
    Btw how much did all of the electronic parts cost you?

  content: "Hi,  I'm glad that the guides are helpful! Thanks for letting me know.\r\n\r\nFor
    the electronics I bought a Ramps v1.2 kit together with a Arduino mega 2560 from
    <a href=\"http://www.reprapsource.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">reprapsource</a>.  This
    came to &euro;94 including shipping and tax.  Then I got the Pololu stepper motor
    drivers from <a href=\"https://shop.grrf.de/pololu-a4983-schrittmotortreiber-p-297.html?zenid=1d819e7cffaaab774373375f6e8d9478\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">grrf.de</a> which cost &euro;40. The 5 stepper motors were ~&euro;55
    from <a href=\"http://www.slidesandballscrews.com/stepper-motors-nema-stepper-motors-c-45_80.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Zapp Automation</a>.  So all in all these parts cost about &euro;200
    - perhaps a bit more including delivery.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

    That is until I read about the Cool settings in Skeinforge. It turns out, if you

<p>An eventful few days, largely dealing with wear and tear maintenance issues.</p>
<h2>X End Idler Split</h2>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-537" href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04275.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-537" title="20110505-DSC04275" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04275-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>It seems that whilst using lubricant on the Z axis rods was a reasonable idea it soaked into the X End Idler and caused weakness between layers (I believe).  This in turn resulted in a slight split and the head of the hot end ploughing through the last few layers of a print.</p>

<p>
  <a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04279.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-538"><img src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04279-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="20110505-DSC04279" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-538" /></a>
  <a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04280.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-539"><img src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04280-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="20110505-DSC04280" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-539" /></a>
</p>

<p>Attempting to realign the print (of a gear) seemed to work fine, but closer inspection shows it was pretty skewed and is not usable as it stands.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-540" href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04283.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-540" title="20110505-DSC04283" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110505-DSC04283-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Luckily the split didn't grow, or affect subsequent prints, so I could print out it's replacement.</p>

<h2>Perfecting the Pulley</h2>

<p>So my circles were coming out oval and I still hadn't printed the perfect pulley. &nbsp;Suspecting that a replacement pulley with a dent in the teeth was the cause of the oval problem I brought the original out of retirement with a quick hack. &nbsp;This allowed me to print a few pulleys, and this time I achieved pulley nirvana. &nbsp;The secret? Cool in Skeinforge. &nbsp;It seems obvious now, but my previous attempts to utilise the cool module didn't work because I was using "orbit". Changing this to "slow down" meant that the spurs and teeth were laid down much slower, and hence with much less deformities!</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-541" href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110508-DSC04286.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-541" title="20110508-DSC04286" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110508-DSC04286-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<h2>Loose X Belt</h2>

<p>Having more faith in the X pulley I was expecting perfect(ish) circles, but no joy. &nbsp;A bit more observation made me realise that the X belt was wobbling quite a bit at the apex of each turn. I had thought the belt was tight enough, but it seems it was not - and tightening it so it "twangs" when tapped results in much better circles.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-542" href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110510-DSC04292.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-542" title="20110510-DSC04292" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/20110510-DSC04292-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

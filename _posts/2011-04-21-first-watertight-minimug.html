  content: Thanks!  I've taken advantage of this long weekend to print a few replacement
    parts and also the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7467" rel="nofollow">Compact
    Geared Extruder by mattroberts</a>.  I'm pretty focussed on designing and printing
    parts for the printer at the moment, but perhaps i'll look for some fun things
    too. I have my eye on the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7976" rel="nofollow">printable
    clock</a>, but it would be quite a challenge I think. :)

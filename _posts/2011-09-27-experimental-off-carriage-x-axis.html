  content: "Very interesting! It might work better, though, on a machine with a Darwin-style
    X/Y axis, so that it could take weight off of a fast-moving axis instead of the
    slow-moving Z-axis. I'm designing a bot of this type and I'll add this to the
    list of mechanisms I'll consider to get the X motor off the Y axis.\r\n\r\nOTOH,
    if you also used a bowden extruder to take the extruder motor weight off of the
    Z-axis, this should make that axis light enough to use a belt drive instead of
    leadscrews and make it just as fast as the other axes. Not sure why you'd need
    that since the Z axis only needs to move in small, infrequent steps during a build,
    but it would be a cool capability."

<p>I recently had an idea about moving the X axis motor off the X carriage. I suspect there is little benefit of doing this, but I felt I had to at least knock out a quick prototype to see it in action.<br />
<a href="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110927-DSC04658.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-781" title="20110927-DSC04658" src="/reprap/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/20110927-DSC04658-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The video below actually details it all quite well, but i'll also add a few pictures and a description below.</p>

<p>So, the idea is to move the X motor off the carriage. One immediate benefit is that the size of the entire X axis is no longer constrained by the size of the motor, perhaps leading to more compact designs? &nbsp;It would be interesting to try out a vertical X axis design with this setup.</p>
<p>Anyway, the X motion is&nbsp;transferred to the belt via a square extrusion rod which drives a cog which sits directly on it. &nbsp;This rod slides through the mount and cog during Z motion. &nbsp;The belt in this design is within the two X smooth rods, but other layouts could be adapted to move the belt to the outside (as with &nbsp;the original Huxley I believe). &nbsp;In this design the hot-end would either have to fit through the belts, or hang over the edge of the rods. &nbsp;Again, here the vertical layout would be interesting.</p>

  content: I have ordered my Laywood filament 2 weeks ago and am waiting for it to
    come in. I have been enjoying your updates and am excited to try it out. On another
    note, I built my first Mendel Prusa using your instructions. Great instructions,
    so thank you for that!

  content: Great stuff!  Always nice to hear!  I'd be interested to hear how you find
    the Laywood filament. So far I'm really enjoying using it but am interested to
    see other people's results.

<p>The wood composite seems well suited for printing some custom parts I designed to supplement the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60112896/">Lillabo Train Set</a> from Ikea.</p>

The parts printed out well on the first go, with only minimal clean-up required due to the oozing.  The circle part of the buffer still had a hole in it even though I set the solid layers to three (infill=20%), but adding a red sticker easily solves that.  </p>
<p>It makes me think that a useful feature for a slicer would be to gradually increase the infill for the last few layers, i.e. 20% on layer n-3, 40% on n-2, 80 on n-1 and then 100% on the top.</p>

  content: "Gary, one more thing, \r\n\r\nOn page 60 of the High Res version, step
    number 4, the Z-smooth bar top clamps, the hex head should be on the side of motors,
    while the rest of the bolt sticks outwards. If one puts in the other way around,
    it will get in the way of the motors."

  content: "Thanks TianChang.  It didn't take all that long really - I found that
    once I got into the flow I could produce the images pretty quickly because importing
    the STL files meant that all the hard work (creating the models) was done.  What
    really took too much time was making the belts look acceptable!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the suggestion for p60.  I had blindly followed the steps and had forgotten
    that I had to do as you say whilst building mine.  I will update the wiki and
    the document when I next get a chance.\r\n\r\nCheers."

  content: "Gary, \r\n\r\nSomemore tips since I just finish a prusa build and it is
    still fresh in my mind. =D\r\n\r\nI may be wrong to, but I had to change out my
    z-motor coupler bolts too, perhaps down to M3 x 20. I find that with the current
    lengths, I cannot reach the maximum z-height that the machine is capable of. \r\n\r\nAnd
    also you might want to include a note to say that \"you might not want to secure
    the z-motors if you have wobbling issues with you x-axis\" This is especially
    true if your threaded rods are not straight. I am at the moment, still trying
    to rectify that on my build. \r\n\r\nHope this helps too."

  content: "I mention about the z-motor coupler bolts because the spinning bolts,
    if too long, will start scraping against the z-axis smooth bar guides. \r\n\r\nAnd
    also, you might want to include a warning against tightening the bar clamps too
    tight. I over-tightened mine and the plastic showed white marks on it. I had one
    which even cracked but is still doing well. hehe. Maybe we can include some sort
    of a guide (range of values of something) to the compression on the bar clamps?"

    mine, and so I will incorporate your comments into the documentation when I next
    get a chance.  \r\n\r\nI think these notes and tips should definitely go into
    the wiki - the question is how to make the suggestions (e.g. modifying the Bill
    of Materials to use M3 x 20 bolts as per your suggestion above) so that it's clear
    and without confusing newcomers.  Perhaps I will try and contact the original
    authors and get some ideas.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Danke!   The software was simply <a target="_blank" href="http://sketchup.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google SketchUp</a>, and I added the <a target="_blank" href="http://sketchuptips.blogspot.com/2010/03/sketchup-stl-importer-redo.html" rel="nofollow">STL Importer plugin</a> so I could use the STL model files from <a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel" rel="nofollow">Prusa's project</a>.  I simply moved the model into the correct position and used the "Export 2D Image" feature.

    Feel free to use/modify the model - I uploaded it to a <a href="https://github.com/garyhodgson/prusa_mendel_visual_instructions/tree/master/src/modelss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">github project</a> too.

  content: "Hi, \r\n\r\nLove the build instructions!  I'm following them for my build.\r\n\r\nFound
    one issue.  You instruct to have the x-axis smooth rods flush on the idler side
    and protruding on the motor side.  As a result you have an interference on pg
    75: the smooth rod is occupying the same space as the motor.  (I don't have my
    motors yet, but it appears that this will be a real problem, not just a modeling
    issue.\r\n\r\nI think the rods need to be flush with the motor mount side and
    there should be no clearance issue on the idler side.\r\n\r\nI second TianChang
    comment.  Anyone reading should be careful not to over tighten. most of my clamps
    are showing stress marks.  It's surprising how little you need to tighten it to
    make it secure.  Go a little bit at a time and check it to see if it moves."

    chance I get.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    are a few differences between these instructions and the maker gear Mendel prusa
    kit.  I'm not finished yet, but so far I have found that the J2 dimension is  250
    for my kit and the pulleys use smaller bearings than the 608s in the instructions
    and also the fender washers are not required.  I'll try to keep track of the other
    differences and post them."

    Hi there,  The original instructions on the Wiki are <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/GPL" rel="nofollow">GPL </a>and the .pub is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html" rel="nofollow">GFDL</a>, and so you are free to use it as you see fit - and a translation would be a great addition!

    And if you let me know the link to where the translation lives (once it's written of course) I will happily put a link to it on the blog page if you wish.

  content: A quick tip for getting the 3rd threaded rod into the vertexes that probably
    belongs in these instructions- run the inside nut on the first end you put in
    way up the bar so you can drop the bar through the vertex enough to line the top
    end up with the other vertexes hole. Otherwise, you might get people trying to
    force them in on an angle and breaking things.

  content: Hi, in Part 7 Instruction 8 you say to tighten the screws in the idler
    but not the motor, yet later on in the document you say to shift the rods over
    as they (may) interfere with the x motor. Wouldn't it be better to tighten the
    motor at 7/8 with rods flush with the end of the holes, and let the idler be the
    adjustable end, since it doesn't matter if we have rod sticking out the end of
    the idler?

    he hasn't gotten back to me. I'm not sure whether he wants the instructions to
    be a part of his Thingidoc, a PDF, or website, etc.  Also, I created the first
    revision as I was building my own Prusa and so it was easy to create the images
    for each step as they were already written on the wiki. \n\nIn the mean time I
    put up a web page that uses Thingidiff to <a href=\"http://garyhodgson.com/reprap/2011/11/comparing-the-printed-parts-between-prusa-mendel-v1-and-v2/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">compare the parts between the two versions</a>, and I converted,and
    cleaned, the STL files to Google Sketchup format ready to build the images - they
    are in the <a href=\"http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/cldetails?mid=b46a2d5143fa9b8b8aa6ccf9542bed8c\"

  content: Hi Jin, If you go the the forums (http://forums.reprap.org) you will see
    that may people have already asked these questions. I will however say that the
    printer should be considered a workshop tool not like a paper laser printer for
    example.  That means it is louder than a regular printer and could potentially
    be a fire hazard (the hot end can get to ~200&deg;C) so care has to be taken.  If
    space is a problem then perhaps consider a <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapPro_Huxley"
    rel="nofollow">huxley</a> or <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Wallace" rel="nofollow">wallace</a>
    as these are smaller.

    Hi,  There's a lot of options for hot-ends nowadays so you really have to make your own research, but for what it's worth I have heard the J-Head is supposed to be quite good (http://hotends.com), and I recently bought a 3mm direct-drive hotend from http://e3d-online.com which appears to be well constructed.  I have only just started using it so it's too early for me to comment on how it prints - though many people are praising them.

    In terms of the connections to the Ramps, the wiki should be able to help you: http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4

    Best of luck!

    Hi Eric,

    Actually the guide is for the even older i1, though it is still quite relevant for i2.  i3 is, as you have already determined, a very different design.

    Best of luck on your build.

    are you willing/able to print the pieces this manual requires for purchase? I
    have a great interest in making a 3D printer. These instructions are light years
    ahead of anything I have found!\r\n\r\nAppreciation and admiration,\r\nDK"

    Hi,  These instructions are for a printer that is now quiet old, I would recommend looking at more recent versions, such as the Prusa i3, or the Mendel90.

    Have a look on the reprap forums and ebay for people selling, or willing to print, parts.
    Best of luck!
